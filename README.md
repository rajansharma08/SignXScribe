# SignXScribe

SignXScribe is a sign language detection tool that uses computer vision and deep learning to interpret sign language gestures from live video input. This tool is designed to bridge the communication gap between sign language users and non-sign language users.

## Features

- Live sign language recognition using OpenCV and TensorFlow
- Pre-trained deep learning models for gesture detection
- Real-time text output for recognized signs
- User-friendly interface for seamless interaction

## Installation
